# Sequential Coin Flip Simulation

## Description

This project simulates a thought experiment inspired by Neil deGrasse Tyson, demonstrating probability and statistical inevitability through a coin flip game. Starting with a set number of participants (coins), each round involves flipping a coin for every active participant. Those who flip tails are eliminated, while those who flip heads advance to the next round. This process repeats until only one participant remains or all participants are eliminated.

## Features

*   **Adjustable Coin Count:** Set the initial number of coins (participants) to start the simulation.
*   **Simulation Control:** Start, reset, and observe the simulation in real-time.
*   **Visual Representation:** Coins are visually displayed, showing their status (active, flipping, heads, tails, out).
*   **Round History:** Track the results of each round, including the number of heads and tails.
*   **Dynamic Messages:** Get real-time updates and messages about the simulation's progress.

## Technologies Used

*   React
*   CSS

## How to Run the Simulation

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Start the application: `npm start`

## Usage

1.  Enter the desired number of coins in the input field.
2.  Click the "Start Sequence" button to begin the simulation.
3.  Observe the coins as they flip and are eliminated each round.
4.  View the round-by-round history to see the progression of the simulation.
5.  Click the "Reset" button to stop the simulation and start over with a new coin count.

## Notes

*   The simulation is purely for demonstration purposes, showcasing probability and randomness.
*   Increasing the number of coins may impact performance due to the visual representation of each coin.
